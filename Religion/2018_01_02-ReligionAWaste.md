Pragmático: "Pessoa com o hábito de ter suas ações, atos e atitudes frente a vida, baseados na verdade absoluta, na praticidade das soluções, de forma que seja sempre o mais objetivo e simples possivel."
Example: Uma pessoa que irá realizar uma viagem, faz um planejamento prévio sobre o seu local de destino, tais como: o clima, costumes, vestimentas, para ter refencia na confecção de sua bagagem, de forma a não vir a ter contratempos."

Comments:
- We need to destroy religion, so humanity can finally wake up from its slumber.﻿
- I think it's hilarious how all of these people watch this documentary, understand nothing about it and how it's demonstrating that their faith is basically a gradual tribalistic fabrication, then they make a comment as if they just became better Christians.﻿
- Remember that time when "God" out of his divine, loving nature gave us freewill and then drowned everyone for not doing what he wants? Or all those plagues? Good times ;)﻿
- since all three religions all believe in the same GOD OF ABRAHAM then it is safe to say that these followers are responsible for all the killings in the name of their faith even though they serve one god... WHAT A WASTE OF BRAIN MATTER. ALL THOSE DEATHS IN THE NAME OF ONE GOD BEING WAGED TO PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED ON THE SAME GOD IS THE CRAZIEST AND MOST EMBARASSING THING IN THE HISTORY OF MAN KIND.﻿
- Religion simply waste of time . Diplomatic approach to multi gods is trinity ONE GOD in three persons. It is all crap.﻿
