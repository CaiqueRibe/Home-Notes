# What is it? 
- Visual basic is a high level programming language developed from the earlier DOS version called BASIC.
- Though, Visual Basic .NET is the latest technology introduced by Microsoft with tons of new features including 
- The .NET framework and educational institues, Universities and Software Development companies have migrated to VB .NET, Visual Basic 6 is still widely learned and taught.

- Learning Visual Basic 6 is quite easier than other programming languages such as C++, C#, Java etc.
  - This is because Visual Basic enables you to work in a graphical user interface where you can just drag and drop controls that you want to work with where you have to write bunches of code to create in C++ or C# or even in Java. 
  - If you are new to programming and want to start it in the smoothest and easiest way, then you should start it with Visual Basic.

# Getting Started with Visual Basic 6.0
- Open a new screen as shown in figure 1 below, with the interface elements Such as `MenuBar, ToolBar, The New Project dialog box.` 
- These elements permit the user to buid different types of Visual Basic applications.
#### Previous versions
- In previous versions of Visual Basic, the IDE was designed as a Single Document Interface (SDI).
-  In a Single Document Interface, each window is a free-floating window that is contained within a main window and can move anywhere on the screen as long as Visual Basic is the current application
- But, in Visual Basic 6.0, the IDE is in a Multiple Document Interface (MDI) format. In this format, the windows associated with the project will stay within a single container known as the parent. Code and form-based windows will stay within the main container form.
#### The Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- One of the most significant changes in Visual Basic 6.0 is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- IDE is a term commonly used in the programming world to describe the interface and environment that we use to create our applications.
- It is called `integrated` because we can access virtually all of the development tools that we need from one screen called an interface.
- The IDE is also commonly referred to as the design environment, or the program.
<br>
- Tha Visual Basic IDE is made up of a number of components

      Menu Bar
      Tool Bar
      Project Explorer
      Properties window
      Form Layout Window
      Toolbox
      Form Designer
      Object Browser
# Components
#### Menu Bar
- This Menu Bar displays the commands that are required to build an application. The main menu items have sub menu items that can be chosen when needed. The toolbars in the menu bar provide quick access to the commonly used commands and a button in the toolbar is clicked once to carry out the action represented by it.
#### Tool Box
- The Toolbox contains a set of controls that are used to place on a Form at design time thereby creating the user interface area. Additional controls can be included in the toolbox by using the Components menu item on the Project menu.<br>

#### Project Explorer
- Docked on the right side of the screen, just under the tollbar, is the Project Explorer window. 
- The Project Explorer as shown in in figure servres as a quick reference to the various elements of a project namely form, classes and modules. All of the object that make up the application are packed in a project. A simple project will typically contain one form, which is a window that is designed as part of a program's interface. It is possible to develop any number of forms for use in a program, although a program may consist of a single form. In addition to forms, the Project Explorer window also lists code modules and classes.<br>

#### Properties Window
- The Properties Window is docked under the Project Explorer window. The Properties Window exposes the various characteristics of selected objects. Each and every form in an application is considered an object.
- Now, each object in Visual Basic has `characteristics` such as color and size. Other characteristics affect not just the appearance of the object but the way it behaves too. All these characteristics of an object are called its `properties`. Thus, a form has properties and any controls placed on it will have propeties too. All of these properties are displayed in the Properties Window.
#### Object Browser
- The Object Browser allows us to browse through the various properties, events and methods that are made available to us. It is accessed by selecting Object Browser from the View menu or pressing the key F2. 
- The `left column` of the Object Browser lists the `objects and classes` that are available in the projects that are opened and the controls that have been referenced in them. It is possible for us to scroll through the list and select the object or class that we wish to inspect. 
- After an object is picked up from the Classes list, we can see its members `(properties, methods and events)` in the `right column`.

  - A property is a small icon that has a hand holding a piece of paper. 
  - Methods are little green blocks
  - While events are small yellow lightning bolt icons.

#### Object naming conversions of controls (prefix)
    Form -frm
    Label-lbl
    TextBox-txt
    CommandButton-cmd
    CheckBox -chk
    OptionButton -opt
    ComboBox -cbo
    ListBox-lst
    Frame-fme
    PictureBox -pic
    Image-img
    Shape-shp
    Line -lin
    HScrollBar -hsb
    VScrollBar -vsb

# Visual Basic 6.0 - Properties, Methods and Events
- All the controls in the ToolBox except the Pointer are objects in Visual Basic. 
- These objects have associated properties, methods and events. 
- Real world objects are loaded with properties. 
  -  a flower is loaded certain color, shape and fragrance.
