- `I don’t have a tidy soundbite for you, because I have learned, I am not a child. And I have learned that when I’ve spoken in anger, I usually regret the way I express myself, So, I’ve been waiting to feel less angry, and when I’m ready, I’ll say what I have to say. Umma Thurman (A bad bitch)`

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for

Nenhum motivo para matar ou morrer
E nem religião, também
